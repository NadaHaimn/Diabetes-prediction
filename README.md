Diabetes Prediction using Logistic Regression

This repository contains a project focused on predicting diabetes outcomes using Logistic Regression. The notebook includes:

- Data Preprocessing: Includes steps to handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address zero-value anomalies in critical features such as SkinThickness and Insulin.
- Data Cleaning: Implements outlier detection and removal to ensure high-quality data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Features visualizations using scatter plots to explore relationships between key features such as Pregnancies, Insulin, BloodPressure, and Glucose.
- Model Training and Evaluation: Trains a Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed data and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook to see the full data cleaning process, visualizations, and model evaluation details. Contributions and feedback are welcome!
